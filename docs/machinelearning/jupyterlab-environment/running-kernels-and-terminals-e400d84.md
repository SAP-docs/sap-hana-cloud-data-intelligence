# Running Kernels and Terminals



When you open your Jupyter notebook for the first time, you will be prompted to specify a kernel version.

After you have opened a notebook with the associated kernel, a kernel session starts. You can keep track of all the sessions that are currently running on the JupyterLab server by clicking the *Running Terminals and Kernels* tab \(<span class="SAP-icons">îˆ…</span>\) in the left-hand panel.

When you close a notebook or terminal, the underlying kernel session continues to run so that long-running processes can continue and you can return to them later. To prevent your JupyterLab instance from consuming more memory than required, ensure that these sessions are shut down when they are no longer required. You can shut down individual sessions or all sessions from the *Running Terminals and Kernels* tab.
