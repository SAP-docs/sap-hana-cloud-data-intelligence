# JupyterLab Environment

In the JupyterLab environment, you can work on your data science experiments by leveraging the power of built-in libraries and extensions.

> ### Note:  
> Responsibility for the support and maintenance of third-party packages installed in the SAP environment rests with the customer, who has the autonomy to install their own Python libraries and third-party software.

Available libraries and extensions include:

-   SAP HANA Python Client API for Machine Learning

-   Predictive Analytics for OEM


JupyterLab supports the package management systems Conda and pip.

You can install your own Python libraries by running the following command in your notebook cell:

```
!pip install <library_name>
```

To import the installed library into your notebook, run command:

```
import <library_name>
```
