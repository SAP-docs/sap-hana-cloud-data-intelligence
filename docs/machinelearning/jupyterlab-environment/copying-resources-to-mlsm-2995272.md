# Copying Resources to MLSM

You can copy your notebook and other files to the existing MLSM scenario.



## Context

> ### Note:  
> This section is valid only for the use cases in which JupyterLab is launched directly from the Lanchpad, not from within MLSM.

It is possiple to copy your notebook and other files to the existing MLSM scenario by following the steps below:



## Procedure

1.  Select the files to be copied on the File Browser on the left side of the screen.

2.  Right-click them and select *Copy to MLSM*.

3.  In the next dialog, select the scenario to which the files are going to be copied.

4.  Confirm the operation.

    Copied files have no link to the original ones. That means if the original files are changed in JupyterLab launched directly from the Launchpad, these changes are not going to be reflected in the files that are now available in a particular scenario.

    > ### Note:  
    > In order for the files to be accessible from the JupyterLab within MLSM, at least one notebook must be copied or created in MLSM.
