# Executing and Deploying Pipelines

The *Pipeline* tab contains pipelines that have been created in ML Scenario Manager. Each pipeline can be executed or deployed depending on its type. Training pipelines can be executed, and inference pipelines can be deployed. Executed or deployed pipelines are shown on the corresponding tabs.
