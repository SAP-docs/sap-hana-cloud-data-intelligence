# Browsing Run Collections and Runs

You can use the metrics explorer to view the metrics and parameters that were applied to a specific run.



## Context

The metrics explorer is integrated with the ML Scenario Manager. You access it by opening a version of your machine learning scenario.



## Procedure

1.  In the header of your ML scenario version, click *Open in Metrics Explorer*.

    The metrics explorer appears showing the run collections on the left and the runs on the right.

2.  Select the run collection that contains the run in which you're interested.

    You can also view run collections and runs from other scenarios by clicking *Edit List* and selecting the scenario that contains the relevant run collections and runs.

    The runs belonging to the selected run collection appear in the right-hand panel.

3.  Click the run to see the applicable metrics and parameters.
