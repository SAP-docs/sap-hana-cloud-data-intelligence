# Adding a Jupyter Notebook

You can create a Jupyter notebook to experiment with your models or to perform other tasks such as feature engineering.



## Procedure

1.  On the *Notebooks* tab of the scenario details page, click *Create*.

2.  Enter a unique name and \(optionally\) a description for your notebook.

    > ### Note:  
    > You can change the description of your notebook at any time by selecting the notebook from the scenario details screen and clicking *Edit*.

3.  Click *Create* to create your Jupyter notebook.

    Your notebook opens in the JupyterLab environment.

## Next Steps

When you open your notebook for the first time, you will be prompted to select your kernel. We recommend that you use Python 3.
