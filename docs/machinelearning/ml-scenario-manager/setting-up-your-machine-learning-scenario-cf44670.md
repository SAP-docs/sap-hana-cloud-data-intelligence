# Setting Up Your Machine Learning Scenario

A machine learning \(ML\) scenario captures all of the artifacts that you need to conduct your data science experiments.



<a name="loiocf44670dbdab4c0ca9571f84902fc656__context_khs_3cx_13b"/>

## Context

An ML scenario collects design-time artifacts \(such as pipelines and Jupyter notebooks\) and run-time artifacts \(such as training runs, models, and model deployments\) that can help you to solve a data science problem. By managing all of these artifacts in *ML Scenario Manager*, data scientists have a central point of access to all of their data assets.



## Procedure

1.  Open *ML Scenario Manager* from the launchpad and click *Create*.

2.  Enter a name for your scenario.

3.  **Optional:** Enter a business question that you want to answer \(such as `How strong will the weekly sales be in our store?`\).

4.  Click *Create*.

    Version 1 of your scenario is created.

## Results

The scenario details screen appears on which you can manage your data science artifacts. From here, you can also change the name or business question of your scenario by clicking *Edit Scenario*, or you can delete the scenario completely.

When you next open the *ML Scenario Manager* app from the launchpad, your scenario will appear in the overview list. You can access the details by clicking the scenario and choosing the version that you want to view.
