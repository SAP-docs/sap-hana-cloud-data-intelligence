# Creating a New Version of Your Scenario

Whenever you make a change to your scenario, you may want to save the scenario as a new version. By doing so, you can return to a previous version of your scenario and make further modifications from there.



## Procedure

1.  Go to the ML Scenario Manager overview page and click the scenario that you want to version.

    The *Version History* panel appears on the right of the screen.

2.  Click the version link to open the scenario from which you want to create a new version.

    This doesn't necessarily have to be the latest version, although your new version will always appear at the top of the timeline. For example, if you have two versions, 1 and 2, creating a new version will always result in version 3, irrespective of whether you create it from version 1 or version 2.

3.  Make your changes and click *Create Version*.

4.  **Optional:** Enter a description for your new version, such as `After adjusting the hyperparameters, accuracy reached 97%`.
