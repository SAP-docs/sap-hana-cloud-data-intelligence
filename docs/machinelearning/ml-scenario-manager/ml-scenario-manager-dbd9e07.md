# ML Scenario Manager

*ML Scenario Manager* helps you to organize your data science artifacts and to manage your tasks in a central location. As a multi-faceted data science application, it is built around the key concept of the machine learning \(ML\) scenario, which may contain datasets, pipelines, and Jupyter notebooks.

You access *ML Scenario Manager* from the SAP Data Intelligence launchpad. You can then use it to create your machine learning scenarios and add artifacts. You can also manage your model performance metrics and deployment history. If necessary, you can version an ML scenario as part of your end-to-end workflow and create a new branch from a previous version.

A typical process within *ML Scenario Manager* involves the following:

-   Managing your datasets and model artifacts

-   Creating Jupyter notebooks for your experiments \(see [JupyterLab Environment](../jupyterlab-environment/jupyterlab-environment-f497d20.md)\)

-   Creating and managing data pipelines

-   Viewing executions and performance metrics

-   Tracking your model deployments

The following video shows you how to create an ML scenario, and execute and deploy pipelines to generate models.
