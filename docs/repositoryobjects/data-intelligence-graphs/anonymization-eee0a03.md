# Anonymization

The anonymization operator helps protect the privacy of individuals by creating groups of similar records so you can discover statistically valid insights from your data without risking re-identification of individuals. The data is written to a terminal. While the graph is running, you can see the generated input data by opening the UI of the input terminal operator. Likewise, you can see the anonymized data by opening the UI of the output terminal operator while the graph is running.
