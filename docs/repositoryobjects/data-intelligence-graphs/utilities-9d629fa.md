The Wiretap operator allows you to inspect messages that are transfered from one operator to another. This graph consists of two parts: one part with group multiplicity of 2, each generating its own series of data and monitoring the data at the first Wiretap opeator Wiretap1 \(ID:wiretap1\), which in turn is connected to the second Wiretap operator Wiretap2 \(ID:wiretap2\) in the default group.
