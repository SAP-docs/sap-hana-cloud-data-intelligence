This example graph shows how a streaming analytics project can use adapters to consume data from a Kafka topic that is produced using a Kafka Producer operator. It also shows how to publish to a Kafka topic that is then consumed using a Kafka Consumer operator. The Kafka Input and Output adapters are added to the streaming analytics operator using Continuous Computation Language \(CCL\).

		column datatypes to a streaming analytics project.")**  
This example graph shows how to send data rows containing various streaming analytics column datatypes to a streaming analytics project.

This is an example of a more complex graph involving streaming analytics operators. In this demo, multiple streaming analytics operators interact to generate and process events such as power alarms and outages, and temperature readings and alarms from a fictional freezer monitor.

This example graph shows how you can send and receive data to and from a streaming analytics operator \(project\) using adapters. You add an adapter to the operator using Continuous Computation Language \(CCL\). With an adapter, all data is sent and received without using any input or output ports. However, you can always add input or output ports as they offer another option to send and receive data.
