# S3

The data generator produces arbitrary data.



The data is written to files on S3 by Write File. The files are stored in the directory `/tmp/demo/` \(of the specified bucket\). The file names follow the scheme `file_<counter>.txt.`

The Read File reads these files and the content is written to a terminal.
