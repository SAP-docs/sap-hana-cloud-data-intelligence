# HTML Viewer

This example graph simulates a Sales Campaign generating pseudorandom data for a large number of stores. The data is generated and structured at the Python3Operator and then passed as a String containing an HTML/CSS document that is displayed on HTML Viewer and constantly refreshed for the duration of the simulation.
