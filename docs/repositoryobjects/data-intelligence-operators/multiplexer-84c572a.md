# Multiplexer

The multiplexer maps the input of any port to all of its output ports.

You can add more input and output ports as needed. The type of all port is `any.*`. This type of port is equivalent to `interface{}` in Go.

> ### Caution:  
> All the input connections have to be of the same type.
