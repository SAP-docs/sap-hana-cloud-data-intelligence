# Structured File Consumer V1 \(Deprecated\)

Structured File Consumer operator reads from any supported cloud storage. This operator was previously supported in Generation 1 graphs.



The operator produces structured output, and you need to connect it to other operators from Structured Data Operators category, for example, [Data Transform V2](data-transform-v2-a415f61.md) or [Structured File Producer V3](structured-file-producer-v3-605e08a.md).

> ### Caution:  
> Support for Microsoft Azure Data Lake Storage Gen1 \(ADL\) in this operator is deprecated.

The supported cloud storages include the following:

-   Microsoft Azure Data Lake Storage V2 \(ADL\_V2\)
-   Google Cloud Storage \(GCS\)
-   Hadoop Distributed File System \(HDFS\)
-   Alibaba OSS \(OSS\)
-   Amazon Simple Storage Service \(S3\)
-   Semantic Data Lake \(SDL\)
-   Microsoft Azure Storage Blob \(WASB\)

> ### Note:  
> This operator produces runtime metrics. See [Operator Metrics](https://help.sap.com/viewer/1c1341f6911f4da5a35b191b40b426c8/Cloud/en-US/994bc115589d40929905dc401263ab10.html "The operators publish a set of metrics as soon as the graph is executed. Each operator provides a different set of metrics.") :arrow_upper_right:.

</td>
<td valign="top">

boolean

</td>
<td valign="top">

Set to True when the automatic calculation doesnâ€™t provide optimal performance. When set to True, each batch of records contains the number of records entered in the Maximum Fetch Size option. For example, when Maximum Fetch Size is set to 1000, and Use Defined Fetch Size is set to True, then there are 1000 records in each batch. When set to False, then each batch is between 10 and 1000 rows.

## Remote Source Description Limitation

When you select a file to be read via the browsing UI, the UI obtains the metadata definition for the file. There are some major limitations with this approach:

1.  CSV files do not have a metadata definition, so the application infers the metadata by looking at the file.
2.  Parquet and ORC files have a metadata definition, but they do not specify the length of strings, which default to 5000.
3.  For 'local' sources, browsing and selection are not supported and the metadata definition is not generated.

Given these facts, the metadata can be wrong, and the job can fail. For strings, the default is to fail the job on strings truncation. However, the operator can be configured to tolerate string truncations by setting the **Fail on string truncation** property to **false**. For 'local' storage type, the behavior is always false and the string data is truncated.
