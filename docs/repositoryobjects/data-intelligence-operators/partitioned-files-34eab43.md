# Partitioned Files

Partitioned files represent separated chunks of a single file.



The partitioned files follow one of the naming patterns below:

-   ```
part-<UUID>-<index>.<extension>

```

-   ```
part-<index>.<extension>
```


Where:

-   **UUID** is an unique ID generated for each operation. Two parts can have the same **index** but different **UUID**. For `Replication Flow`, the UUID is usually composed by the following parts: `<unix_timestamp>-<workOrderID-1>-<deliminationNo-01>`

-   **index** represents which specific chunk of the file is included in the respective part.
-   **extension** is the same as the target file.

A partitioned file target directory is only considered as valid if the `_SUCCESS` indicator file is present.

The indicator file has no contents.

The lack of this file indicates an ongoing operation.

The directory name must contain the extension of the partitioned files.

Examples of partitioned files on the file system are listed below:

        part-0000-2.csv
        part-0000-3.csv
