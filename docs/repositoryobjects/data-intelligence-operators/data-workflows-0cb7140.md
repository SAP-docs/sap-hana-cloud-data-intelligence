# Data Workflows

The graphs modeled with the data workflow operators are referred to as Data Workflows.

Modeler categorizes certain operators as Data Workflow operators, which run for a limited time and finish with the status of *completed* or *dead*. This section describes the supported Data Workflow operators in SAP Data Intelligence.
