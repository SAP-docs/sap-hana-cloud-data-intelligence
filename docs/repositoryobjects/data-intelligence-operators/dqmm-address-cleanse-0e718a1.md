# DQMm Address Cleanse

With the DQMm Address Cleanse operator, you can prepare address cleanse requests to be sent to the SAP Data Quality Management, microservices for location data.



SAP Data Quality Management, microservices for location data offers cloud-based microservices for address cleansing, geocoding, and reverse geocoding. You can embed address cleansing and enrichment services within any business process or application so that you can quickly reap the value of complete and accurate address data.

This operator will create requests from your data that can then be passed to the DQMm Client operator.

The list of result field names separated by commas that specify the fields from the service that will be output.

Default: "std\_addr\_address\_delivery, std\_addr\_locality, std\_addr\_region, std\_addr\_postcode\_full, std\_addr\_country\_2char"

The original input fields will be included in the output. If an output field name has the same name as an input field, then the input field will be overwritten on output. If you wish to retain the original input, you should map the output field to a different name.

-   empty: Default value. Use the default service value or the value present in the configuration if one is specified.

-   both: The service cleanses address data and appends geo-location coordinates, provided the request includes output fields from both processes.
-   addressOnly: The service performs only cleansing address data, not appending geo-location coordinates. If the request includes output fields for the geo-location process, the values for those fields will be empty in the response. In this mode, a transaction is counted for the address, but not for the geo-location.
-   geoOnly: The service performs only appending geo-location coordinates, not cleansing address data. If the request includes output fields for the cleansed address, the values for those fields will be empty in the response. In this mode, a transaction is counted for the geo-location, but not for the address. This mode should be used only when the address data sent in the request has previously gone through address cleansing, or when you have high confidence in the quality of the address data.
