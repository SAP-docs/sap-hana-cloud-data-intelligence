# Structured Data Operators

You can model a flow and build a transformation pipeline that will move data from the source\(s\) to the target\(s\) while transforming the data in the process without having to create custom operators.

-   **[Cloud Table Producer](cloud-table-producer-33f1ab7.md "The Cloud Table Producer operator reads from any table input and produces a table in the
		specified database.")**  
The Cloud Table Producer operator reads from any table input and produces a table in the specified database.
-   **[Data Transform V2](data-transform-v2-a415f61.md "The Data Transform operator in Modeler provides a wide variety of options available to meet your data transformation needs. Supported in
		Generation 2 graphs.")**  
The Data Transform operator in Modeler provides a wide variety of options available to meet your data transformation needs. Supported in Generation 2 graphs.
-   **[SAP Application Consumer V2](sap-application-consumer-v2-7a1527d.md "Use the SAP Application Consumer operator to consume data from SAP and non-SAP sources as modeled in a graph. Supported in Generation 2
		graphs. ")**  
Use the SAP Application Consumer operator to consume data from SAP and non-SAP sources as modeled in a graph. Supported in Generation 2 graphs.
-   **[SAP Application Producer V2](sap-application-producer-v2-c8095cf.md "Use the SAP Application Producer to write data to SAP and non-SAP sources as modeled in a graph. This operator is supported in Generation
		2 graphs.")**

-   **[SQL Consumer V2](sql-consumer-v2-a4a74c3.md "SQL Consumer operator reads from a specified database using native SQL. Supported in Generation 2
		graphs.")**  
SQL Consumer operator reads from a specified database using native SQL. Supported in Generation 2 graphs.
-   **[Structured File Consumer V3](structured-file-consumer-v3-02d49cc.md "Structured File Consumer operator reads from any supported cloud storage. This operator is supported in Generation 2
		graphs.")**  
Structured File Consumer operator reads from any supported cloud storage. This operator is supported in Generation 2 graphs.
-   **[Structured File Producer V3](structured-file-producer-v3-605e08a.md "Structured File Producer operator reads from any table input and produces a file (CSV, ORC, or Apache Parquet) in the specified storage.
		This operator is supported in Generation 2 graphs.")**  
Structured File Producer operator reads from any table input and produces a file \(CSV, ORC, or Apache Parquet\) in the specified storage. This operator is supported in Generation 2 graphs.
-   **[Table Consumer V2](table-consumer-v2-1e5f0ee.md "Table Consumer operator reads from a specified database table or view. Supported in Generation 2
		graphs.")**  
Table Consumer operator reads from a specified database table or view. Supported in Generation 2 graphs.
-   **[Table Producer V3](table-producer-v3-092de44.md "The Table Producer operator reads from any table input and produces a table in the specified database.  This operator is supported in
		Generation 2 graphs.")**
