# ABAP

Use the ABAP operators to access data in ABAP-based remote systems from SAP Data Intelligence.



If you want to extract data from ABAP-based SAP systems, you can use the `Read Data From SAP System` operator. It supports reading data from CDS views and from tables \(using SAP Landscape Transformation Replication Server \(SLT\)\).
