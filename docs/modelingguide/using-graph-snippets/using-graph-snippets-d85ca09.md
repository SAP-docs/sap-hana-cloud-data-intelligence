# Using Graph Snippets

SAP Data Intelligence provides a group of commonly used operators that you can add as a single entity to the graph instead of adding and configuring the operators individually.

A graph snippet is an entity that contains a group of operators and connections. The group performs a single logical function. You can import graph snippets to your graph.

To learn how to set up and run each graph snippet, see [Graph Snippets](https://help.sap.com/viewer/9182d964573745e89f523395d7c43e53/Dev/en-US/46542f8e453e48afa448c3b50caafdb5.html "") :arrow_upper_right: in the *Repository Objects Reference*.
