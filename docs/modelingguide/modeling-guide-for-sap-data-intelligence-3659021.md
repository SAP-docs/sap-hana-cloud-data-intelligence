# Modeling Guide for SAP Data Intelligence

The Modeling Guide contains information about using the SAP Data Intelligence Modeler.

The SAP Data Intelligence Modeler helps create data processing graphs and provides a runtime and design-time environment for data-driven scenarios. The tool reuses existing coding and libraries to orchestrate data processing in distributed landscapes.

The following tasks require some expertise and programming skills:

-   Creating operators
-   Creating types
-   Creating Dockerfiles
-   Working with the subengines in the SAP Data Intelligence Modeler

If youâ€™re new to these tasks, or to modeling, we recommend that you start your learning journey by creating graphs with only the built-in \(predefined\) operators that the modeler provides.
