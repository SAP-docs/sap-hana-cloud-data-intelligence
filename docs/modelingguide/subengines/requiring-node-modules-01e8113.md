# Requiring Node Modules

A Node.js operator runs in its own process, therefore, it can also require its own individual set and version of node modules.

A Node.js operator with its own set of node modules, provides you with greater flexibility, for example:

-   Reuse your JavaScript libraries.
-   Reuse your third-party Node.js modules.
