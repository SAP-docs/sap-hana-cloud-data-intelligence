# The Node.js Subengine SDK

The Node.js subengine SDK module simplifies the development of Node.js operators.



The Node.js subengine SDK is a Node.js module named `'@sap/vflow-sub-node-sdk'`. The Node.js module allows easy access to the following elements:

-   In and out ports defined in the `operator.json` file.
-   Static operator configuration defined in the `operator.json` file.
-   Additional ports that you add directly in the SAP Data Intelligence Modeler.
-   Dynamic configuration that you add directly in the SAP Data Intelligence Modeler.
-   System-logging API with which you send status information about the operator.

The Node.js SDK also supports a shutdown hook for the operator. The shutdown hook cleans resources, if necessary, such as closing files or logging out from remote systems before terminating the operator.
