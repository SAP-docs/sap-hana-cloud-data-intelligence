# Monitoring SAP Data Intelligence 

SAP Data Intelligence provides a stand-alone monitoring application to monitor the status of graphs run in the Modeler. The Monitoring application provides capabilities to visualize the summary of graphs run in the SAP Data Intelligence Modeler with relevant charts.

The Monitoring application also allows you to schedule graph runs. For each graph instance, the Monitoring application provides details for processes like the following:

-   Graph run status.
-   Time of graph run.
-   Graph type.
-   Graph source.

The Monitoring application allows you to open a graph in the Modeler, view graph configurations, or stop process runs.

You can also view the execution and configuration of replication flows and their associated tasks.

## Monitoring Policy

Developer member users assigned the `sap.dh.monitoring` policy can view analytics and instances of graphs for all tenant users. However, the policy doesn't provide member user access to schedules.

Without the policy, member users can monitor only their own graphs.
