# Edit an Existing Replication Flow

You can import, edit, and update replication flows that have been deployed by you or other users to the shared repository.



## Context

A replication flow that you create is saved in your user repository until you deploy it to the shared repository. Then, other users can view, import, or update \(overwrite\) the replication flow.

The left pane of the *Replications* editor lists all of the replication flows available to you. Hover over a name to see details for that replication flow.



## Procedure

1.  Right-click a replication flow to see the delete or import options. To import a replication flow, right-click it to display the context menu and choose *Import from shared repository*.

    The system copies the replication flow to your user repository, overwriting any existing versions.

2.  You can now edit the configuration of the replication flow and save it without affecting the version in the shared repository.

    For example, to delete a dataset from the replication flow, on the *Tasks* tab, select the dataset and choose *Delete*.

3.  To replace \(overwrite\) the version in the shared repository, Deploy the replication flow.

    A change list displays your changes plus any that might have been made to this replication flow by other users at the same time.
