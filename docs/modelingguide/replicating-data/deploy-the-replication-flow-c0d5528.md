# Deploy the Replication Flow

Deploy the replication flow to enable its execution.



## Context

After creating the replication flow and configuring its tasks, you deploy the replication flow so it can be run. Deployment also saves the replication flow in the shared repository where it will be available for other users to view, import, or modify.

Note that once deployed, you cannot change the replication flow's source and target connections or containers.



## Procedure

1.  Display the replication flow to deploy.

2.  Select the :magic_wand: icon in the toolbar.

    The *Activity Monitor* displays the status of deployment. You can choose the error message text to display and copy the full error message.

    You can also view the *Log* tab for processing details.
