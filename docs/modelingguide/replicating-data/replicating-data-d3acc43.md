# Replicating Data

SAP Data Intelligence replication flows let you transfer small or large datasets, in batch or real-time, from a source to a target using full or delta loading.

You create a replication flow by first configuring source and target connections. Then add one or more tasks, each of which consists of a source object, its corresponding target, and any associated configuration options such as filters or custom mappings. Finally, save it in your user space.



## Deploying and Undeploying Replication Flows

After creating and validating a replication flow, you deploy it to the shared \(tenant\) repository, where you can run it. Deployment also makes the replication flow available to other users of the tenant for viewing, importing, or modification.

You can undeploy your replication flow for various reasons, such as:

-   You want to delete that replication flow from the shared repository because it no longer needs to be run.

-   You wish to modify the replication flow and redeploy it.

Undeploying deactivates the flow from the replication service and performs some housekeeping of the connected source system and of runtime artifacts of the replication service within SAP Data Intelligence Cloud. For more specific details, see [Undeploy a Replication Flow](undeploy-a-replication-flow-4e7d434.md).

The SAP Data Intelligence Monitoring application provides an interface where you can view and manage replication flow and task processes.

## Possible Duplication of Records

If you use replication flows with any target system, the data replication process provides "at-least-once delivery". Therefore, duplicate change records may be delivered to the target system, which results in eventual consistency when the replication is recovering the data load in error situations.

However, when the target system is a database \(such as HANA Cloud\), the duplicates are eliminated during the replication execution by using the UPSERT mechanism of the databases, thereby providing "exactly-once delivery".

For other targetsâ€”for example, Amazon Web Service Storage Services \(S3\), Microsoft Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 \(ADL\_V2\), Google Cloud Service \(GCS\), or HANA Data Lake \(HDL\) file, use *Suppress Duplicates* to minimize the occurrence of duplicates during the initial load. For more information about duplicate suppression, see [Create a Replication Flow](create-a-replication-flow-a425e34.md).

For duplicate records that can't be automatically eliminated in the target cloud storage, use the information provided in the timestamp column to help you identify the currently valid record and ignore potential duplicated records.

Also note that because source rows may be sent multiple times in an effort to maintain data consistency, the replication may present a replication row count that is greater than the actual rows in the target.
