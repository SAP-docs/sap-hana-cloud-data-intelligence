# Using Scenario Templates

SAP Data Intelligence provides common graph scenarios that you can use with operators and graphs.

Find the templates that are shipped as example graphs in the Modeler application Graphs tab in the navigation pane at left. Make sure that you include *Scenario Templates* in the visible categories by selecting <span class="SAP-icons"></span> \(Customize Visible Categories\).You can also search for the package `com.sap.scenarioTemplates`.

To learn how to set up and run each scenario template, see “Scenario Templates” in *Repository Objects Reference*.
