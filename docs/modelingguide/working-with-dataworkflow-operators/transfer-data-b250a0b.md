# Transfer Data

The Data Transfer operator allows you to transfer data from specific source systems to specific target systems.

Use the Data Transfer operator in SAP Data Intelligence Modeler in a data workflow for the following tasks:

-   Transferring data from SAP Business Warehouse or SAP HANA.
-   Loading data to cloud storages, such as Amazon S3, Google Cloud Platform, and Hadoop Distributed File System.

Before you use the Data Transfer operator in the data workflow, create connections to source and target systems using the SAP Data Intelligence Connection Management application. When you configure the Data Transfer operator, browse and select the source and target connections.
