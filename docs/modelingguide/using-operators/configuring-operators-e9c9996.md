3.  To define new configuration parameters for the selected operator, perform the following substeps:

    1.  Select :heavy_plus_sign: in the *Configuration* pane.

        > ### Note:  
        > You can define configuration parameters only for some base operators. Therefore, :heavy_plus_sign: is available only for applicable operators.

    2.  Enter a name for the new configuration parameter in *Add Property*.

    3.  Choose the property type.

    4.  Enter a value in *Value*.
