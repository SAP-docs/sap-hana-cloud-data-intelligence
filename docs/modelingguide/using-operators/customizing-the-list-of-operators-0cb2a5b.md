# Customizing the List of Operators

Limit the list of operator categories in the *Operators* tab to include only the operators that you use.



## Context

The SAP Data Intelligence Modeler groups and displays operators in the navigation pane under specific categories, and initially lists all categories of operators. To control the categories listed so that you see only the operators that you use, perform the following steps:



## Procedure

1.  Open the *Operators* tab from the Navigation pane at left.

2.  Select <span class="SAP-icons">î…°</span> \(Customize Visible Categories\) next to the *Search* text box.

    The *Customize Category Visibility* dialog opens showing a list of operator categories.

3.  Deselect *Select All*.

    This step is only necessary if you haven't edited the category list previously.

4.  Check each category to view in the list of operator categories.

5.  Click away from the list.

    The selected categories and their operators appear in the *Operators* tab.

    > ### Tip:  
    > To display the operators in a specific category, enter the name of the category in the *Search* text box.
    > 
    > To find a specific operator, enter the name of the operator in the *Search* text box.
