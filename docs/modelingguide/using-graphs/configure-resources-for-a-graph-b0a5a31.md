2.  Click anywhere on the graph or select a group within the graph and choose ![](images/Config2_1_afd8b6e.png) \(Show Configuration\).

3.  In the *Configuration* panel, go to the *Resources* section and click ![](images/Edit1_01244d0.png) \(Edit\).

4.  In the *Resource Configuration* dialog, add or modify the resource requests and limits as required.

5.  Specify the *Resource Type*, *Value*, and *Unit* for the *Requests* and *Limits*, and click *OK*.

    > ### Note:  
    > If you donâ€™t provide explicit configuration for a selected group, the graph level configuration is applicable by default.
