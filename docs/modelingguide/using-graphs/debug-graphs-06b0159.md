# Debug Graphs

You can start the graph in debug mode to verify the input and output from each operator during execution and analyze or modify the data passing through a connection.

## Context

Debug mode enables debugging capabilities on the execution of a pipeline and allows you to investigate the whole pipeline step by step to make it bug free. You can inspect data at a specific stage of a pipeline execution, detect data quality issues, perform a root cause analysis of the detected problems, and try corrective actions.

> ### Note:  
> The debug feature is not supported for generation 1 graphs with structured data operators.

## Procedure

1.  In the graph editor, open the graph that you want to debug.

2.  In the editor toolbar, choose the ![](images/Run1_ff38da3.png) \(Debug\) menu option.

    The graph executes in debug mode.

3.  To view the debugging status of the graph, open the *Status* tab in the bottom panel and select the graph to open it in the monitoring/runtime view.

    In the runtime view, the *Debug Panel* opens and lists all the breakpoints in the graph. You can select a specific operator in the graph to see the breakpoints associated with that operator.

4.  To filter the results in the debug panel, click <span class="SAP-icons">ÓÅñ</span> and choose from one of the following:

    -   *Breakpoint*: Displays only breakpoints.
    -   *Hit*: Displays breakpoints and streaming points that are hit.
    -   *Streaming*: Displays only streaming points.


-   **[Add Breakpoints to a Graph](add-breakpoints-to-a-graph-a8d10fd.md "Breakpoints and streaming points allow you to inspect the data transformation occurring
		throughout the pipeline when you run in Debug mode.")**  
Breakpoints and streaming points allow you to inspect the data transformation occurring throughout the pipeline when you run in *Debug* mode.
