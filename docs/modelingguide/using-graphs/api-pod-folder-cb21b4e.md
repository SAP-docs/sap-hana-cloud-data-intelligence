# api-pod Folder

The `api-pod` folder contains information about vFlow API nodes.

The folder structure is similar to the *<group-instance-id\>* folder, except that it does not contain a `heap.txt` file. A `heap.txt` file can become quite large for long-running vFlow API nodes, and it is rarely used.
