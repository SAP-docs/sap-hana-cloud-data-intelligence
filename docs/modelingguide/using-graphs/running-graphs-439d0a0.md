# Running Graphs

After creating a graph, you can run the graph based on the configuration defined for the graph. The Modeler application runs the operators in the graph as individual processes.



## Procedure

1.  Open the applicable graph in a graph editor.

2.  Select the down arrow next to :arrow_forward: in the editor toolbar.

3.  Choose one of the run choices.

    -   *Run*: Runs the graph immediately.
    -   *Run As*: *Run As*: Runs the graph after you configure additional settings, such as automatic restart, and snapshots. The following table describes the *Run As* options.

    > ### Note:  
    > The *Run* and *Run As* options trigger graph validation before running the graph. The Modeler displays the results in the *Validation* tab. For more information, see [Validate Graphs](validate-graphs-0857b43.md).

4.  Complete the options in the *Run As* dialog box as described in the following table.


    <table>
    <tr>

    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Required. Specifies a unique name for the run.
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *Trace Level*
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Sets the trace severity threshold, which determines the trace messages that are sent to the trace server. Choose one of the following options:

    -   INFO
    -   DEBUG
    -   ERROR
    -   FATAL
    -   WARN

    For complete descriptions of the Trace Level options, see [Trace Severity Levels](trace-severity-levels-34cad34.md).
    
    </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td valign="top">
    
    *Configuration Substitutions group*
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Contains all the configuration substitution parameters for the operators in the graph.

    If you defined configuration substitution parameters for the operators in the graph, all the configuration substitution parameters display in the *Configuration Substitutions* group.

    Provide the required values for the following options as necessary:

    -   HANA\_DB
    -   file\_connection\_id
    -   file\_path
    -   select\_statement

    > ### Note:  
    > If there are conditional configuration properties for an operator, regardless of the property that is visible in the configuration panel, the *Run As* dialog box still displays all the configuration substitution parameters. It's optional to provide values for the substitution parameters that are hidden in the Modeler.

    *Capture Snapshot*
    
    </td>
    <td valign="top">
    
    Saves a snapshot \(intermediate state\) of the graph for efficient recovery.

    > ### Note:  
    > Snapshot configuration is available for graphs only with Generation 2 operators.

5.  Select *OK* to save your settings and to start running the graph.
