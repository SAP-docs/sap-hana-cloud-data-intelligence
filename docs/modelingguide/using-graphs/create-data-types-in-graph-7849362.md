# Create Data Types in Graph

You can create graph-level data types and use them in the graph along with the automatically generated data types.



## Context

To create additional data types to the existing automatically generated data types, perform the following steps in the Modeler:



## Procedure

1.  Open the applicable graph in the graph editor.

2.  Select <span class="SAP-icons">î‰‚</span> \(Show Configuration\) in the editor toolbar.

3.  Expand the *Data Types* section and select :heavy_plus_sign: 

4.  Enter a unique ID for your data type in the *ID* text box.

5.  Choose *Structure*, *Table*, or *Scalar* for *Type*.

6.  Select *OK*.

    The new data type appears in the list of data types in the *Data Types* section.

7.  **Optional:** Select :pencil2: next to the data type name to set additional properties.

    The available properties to set are based on the data type.
